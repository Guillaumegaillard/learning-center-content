# Step 1: Basic Wireing

This page will help you wireing the soil moisture sensor with the arduino.


# Step 2: First measurements

On this page we will read the first measurement by programming the Arduino.


# Step 3: Continuously measurements

Now will we improve the arduino code to continuously reading measurements.

# Step 4: Test the relay

Now we program the relay in Arduino.

# Step X:

Let's automate the watering by conecting a pump and a relay...
