As you may already know, plants require water, light(usually sunlight), nutrients etc,...to grow healthy. While these factors can be easily provided, the problem is usually forgetfulness.

Luckily for us we can use smart electronic devices to automate some of the above mentioned entities required for plan growth, specifically watering.

Here's what we will be learning:
- What parts are needed
- How to wire up and read sensor values
- How to wire up and trigger an actuator
- How to use the actuator to control a water pump
