The term “Internet of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999. 
Ashton, who was working in supply chain optimization, wanted to attract senior management’s attention to a new exciting technology called RFID. 
Because the internet was the hottest new trend in 1999, he called his presentation “Internet of Things”.

The internet of things is an extension of the current internet, further into the physical world.
We can collect data from the physical world using sensors and also effect changes in the physical world using actuators or effectors.
