The second course will take us through the WaziGate parts and features. First off all, we will download and install the WaziGate ISO image on a SD card. The next step is to connect the gateway to the internet, finding the gateway IP address. Additionally, we will configure the gateway with our Cloud credentials.
The next step is to set up LoraWan, and configure our sensors and actuators within the WaziGate UI. For this, we will flash an example LoRaWAN program in the WaziDev and copy over the LoRaWAN keys.
