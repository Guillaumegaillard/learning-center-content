This course covers the API of Waziup. The API gives a programmer access to all Waziup features. This allows the user to develop his own IoT Web application, based on Waziup gateways and backend. For instance, the user can retrieve the data from his sensors, and display them in the most appropriate way for his customers. The Waziup API is available both with HTTP and MQTT protocols.
