This course will cover the basics of using the WaziCloud. The first step is to create an account on Web interface. The course will then show how to create and connect devices. This will allow us to monitor the device status and data. Gateways can also be managed on the WaziCloud, with the remote maintenance feature. 
We will also show how the WaziCloud can be used to create “Notifications”. This powerful feature allow you to receive messages on Social Networks if some conditions are met regarding the sensor measurements. It also allows us to create an “Actuation loop”: we can trigger an actuator based on some condition.Finally, the “projects” feature is demonstrated, allowing the user to conveniently group the various devices and gateways in a single deployment.
