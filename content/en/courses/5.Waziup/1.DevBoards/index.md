title: Development boards
description: Waziup compatible development boards
---


This first course will cover the development boards that are usable with Waziup. In particular, we will overview the Waziup development boards, namely WaziDev, WaziSense and WaziAct. We will install the Waziup libraries and sketches into the Arduino IDE, install the Waziup board drivers, and test our setup with a simple ping pong example.

We will go through the transmission of data from a single and multiple sensors to the WaziCloud. We will also perform actuation using WaziACT. This includes actuating a simple relay, using the “downlink” capacity of LoRaWAN.

We will then deploy a simple battery powered sensor node, and cover the notions of deep sleep & autonomy of devices. Finally, we will see how to transmit data directly from the device to WaziCloud, without WaziGate. This requires the use of an ESP32 with Wifi. We will transmit single or multiple sensor data, and program actuation.
