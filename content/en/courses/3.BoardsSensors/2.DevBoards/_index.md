IoT Development board Catagories : Arduino 
===

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that consists of both hardware and software components. At its core, an Arduino development board is a physical computing platform designed to make it easy for hobbyists, students, and professionals to create interactive electronic projects. The development board provides a simple and flexible way to interface with sensors, actuators, and other electronic components.

Key features of Arduino development boards include:

1. Microcontroller: The heart of the Arduino board is a microcontroller, which is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. Different Arduino boards may use various microcontrollers, such as the popular Atmel AVR series or ARM-based processors.

2. Input/Output (I/O) Pins: Arduino boards typically have a set of digital and analog input/output pins that allow you to connect the board to various electronic components, such as sensors, LEDs, motors, and more. These pins can be programmed to read inputs or control outputs.

3. USB Interface: Arduino boards often come with a built-in USB interface, making it easy to connect the board to a computer for programming and communication. The USB interface is also used to power the Arduino board in many cases.

4. Programming Environment: Arduino uses a simplified programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) that is easy for beginners to learn. The language is based on C/C++ but is simplified for ease of use.

5. Open-Source: Arduino is open-source, meaning that the hardware designs and software code are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This open nature has contributed to the widespread adoption of Arduino in the maker and electronics communities.

6. Shields: Arduino shields are additional boards that can be stacked on top of the main Arduino board to provide additional functionalities, such as WiFi connectivity, motor control, or GPS.

Arduino boards are versatile and widely used for a variety of projects, ranging from simple LED blinking exercises for beginners to complex robotics and home automation systems. They serve as an excellent platform for learning about electronics and programming, and their accessibility has contributed to the growth of the maker movement.

There are multiple versions of Arduino boards are available in the market. Some of them are explained here.

## Arduino Uno Rev3
---
The Arduino UNO is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board you can start playing with. The UNO is the most used and documented board of the whole Arduino family.

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your Uno without worrying too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.

## Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3
---

The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560 [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf). It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Mega 2560 board is compatible with most shields designed for the Uno and the former boards Duemilanove or Diecimila.

## Arduino Nano
---

The Arduino Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board based on the ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3.x) [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf). It has more or less the same functionality of the Arduino Duemilanove, but in a different package. It lacks only a DC power jack, and works with a Mini-B USB cable instead of a standard one.

## Arduino Micro
---
The Micro is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4 [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7766-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16U4-32U4_Datasheet.pdf), developed in conjunction with Adafruit. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a micro USB cable to get started. It has a form factor that enables it to be easily placed on a breadboard.

The Micro board is similar to the Arduino Leonardo in that the ATmega32U4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. This allows the Micro to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port.

## Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi
---

The Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi is designed for ambitious makers who want to step up their game. It levels the playing field for gamers, artists, sound designers and anyone coming to the tech world with big ideas on a budget â€“ because it packs advanced features into an accessible component, with the same form factor as our popular Mega and Due.
