In this lesson, we'll learn the basics about Machine Learning (ML).

# General Introduction

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI. Machine learning is a process that uses an algorithm to analyze data, learn from the data and make a statement or prediction about it. Unlike software, which was programmed by hand and performed tasks by specific instructions, the machine is trained using large amounts of data and algorithms. This allows her to learn how to perform a task.

The algorithms had been evolved in recent years to include:
- decision trees
- induced logic programs
- clustering
- reinforcement learning
- Bayesian networks
- ... !!! TODO: maybe exclude, because more specific deviation later...

But none reached the goal of "Artificial General Intelligence" and even “Artificial Narrow Intelligence” was difficult to achieve with early machine learning approaches.

# Applications

It turned out that one of the best areas of application for machine learning was the Computer Vision program. However, a lot of manual programming was required for the machine learning to work. Data Scientists wrote classifiers like Edge Detection Filters. The program could now figure out where objects began and where they ended, recognize the shape of an object, and recognize the letters STOP. From this, an algorithm was developed that recognized images and learned what a stop sign is. That's a good idea, but on days when it was very foggy, for example, or trees partially covered the sign, the algorithm was rarely able to identify the sign.

There are also other important areas where machine leaning is applied. Ma

# Overview of different Machine learning algorithms grouped by similarity

In the following there is an overview about the different algorithms that are being used in machine learning, they are grouped by similarity.

## Algorithms used for Regression Analysis

Regression algorithms are trying to map an association between variables. Models are refined by the measurement of errors in predictions that are made by a model.

Regression methods are originated from the scientific field of statistics and had been adopted to statistical machine learning.

Here are some examples of Regression Analysis:

- Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
- Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)

## Algorithms that are instance-based

Instance-based learning, also called memory-based learning, is a learning algorithm, which instead of performing a generalization, compares an input with instances seen during training. This means the complexity to solve the problem will grow with the learned data, which was used during training. 

Here are some examples of algorithms that are instance-based:

- k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
- kernel machines
- Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
- Radial basis function network (RBF)
- Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Algorithms used for regularization

Regularization is a technique used in Regression Analysis to reduce complexity of a model and shrink coefficients of independent features.
So the task of regularization is to convert complex models into simpler ones, that need less computational cost and also avoid the risk of overfitting. 

Here are some examples of algorithms that are used for regularization:

- Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression (LASSO) (L1)
- Ridge Regression (L2)
- Elastic-Net Regression
- Least-Angle Regression (LARS)

## Algorithms used for Decision Trees

Decision Trees belong to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms. They can be used in classification and regression. Consequently there are two types of decision trees:

1. **Categorical** Variable Decision Trees: Solves a classification problem, the leaves of the tree represent the categories. 
2. **Continuous** Variable Decision Trees: Solves a regression problem, the leaves are "bins" that represent ranges in a numerical space.

Here are some examples of algorithms that are used for decision trees:

- Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
- C4.5 and C5.0 (successor of ID3)
- Classification And Regression Tree (CART)
- Chi-square automatic interaction detection Performs multi-level splits when computing classification trees (CHAID)
- Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)
- Decision Stumps
- Conditional Decision Trees

## Algorithms that implement Bayes' Theorem

The Bayes' Theorem provides a way of thinking about the relationship between data and a specific model. The theorem is a method to determine conditional probabilities, this means the probability of a specific event occurring, if another event already occurred. Bayesian can be applied to solve regression and classification problems.

Here are some examples of algorithms that implement Bayes' Theorem:

- Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
- Bayesian Network (BN)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)

## CLustering Algorithms

Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that aims to group similar data points.
