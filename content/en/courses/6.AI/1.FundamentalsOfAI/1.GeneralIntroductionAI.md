# General Introduction

When people think of AI, most of them think of **Artificial General Intelligence** (AGI). An AGI can do everything what humans do (and even better). But the sad truth is, that mankind is not even close to develop a "real AGI".
Nowadays AI is very focused to a specific use case, therefore one can speak of a **Artificial Narrow Intelligence** (ANI). Because you train it on a specific thing its capabilities are limited. If you try to use it for another task, it will not perform like you would expect it to perform.

**In this tutorial we will concentrate on ANI.**

AI is separated in many subfields, in the following we will elaborate on some of them.

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Leaning (DL)
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

How the fields overlap and are interlinked is conveyed in the following visualization.

Artificial Intelligence is the most general scientific field. One subfield of Artificial Intelligence is Machine Learning. It describes algorithms with a ability to learn a task, without being explicitly programmed to do so. A subfield of Machine Learning is Deep Learning. Computer Vision and for example the late development in Natural Language Processing are part of Deep Learning. Deep Learning can be understood as a subset of Machine Learning, here with help of e.g. convolutional neural networks is is being possible to learn and process great amounts of data.
