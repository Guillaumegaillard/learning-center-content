In this lesson, we'll learn the basics about Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing examines how natural language in the form of text or language data can be processed algorithmically with the help of computers. It is the interface between linguistics and computer science. The goal of NLP is the capability of understanding the contents of documents and accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

The most common challenges in NLP are:
 - speech recognition
 - natural language understanding
 - natural language generation
