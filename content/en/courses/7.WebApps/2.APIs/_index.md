This course will show you how to use HTTP and MQTT APIs. We will go through the architecture of each protocol, and how to send and retrieve data. Additionally, the course will show you how to design APIs, with all the do’s and don’ts.

REST means REpresentational State Transfer. It is a standard to create APIs.

- The API represents the state of database at a time.
- Everything is a resource with a URL.
- Resources can have different representations: e.g. text, XML or JSON.
- Based on the HTTP standard.
- Client-Server architecture.
- Stateless (fire-and-forget).
