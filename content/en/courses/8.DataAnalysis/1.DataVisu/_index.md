Introduction
============

The visualization of data is a graphical representation of information. With utilizing visual elements like charts, maps and graphs, one can understand the data an judge on patterns, tendencies or exceptions.

It is part art science and part art. The objective is to get the science part and the art part right. There are many visualizations that only get part of it right. Information needs to presented in a way, that it allows the observer to retrieve it effortless. On the other hand, aesthetics are also important. A good visualization should be also pleasing to look at.  

DataViz is an effective way to share complex information that is difficult to convey in words. Charts, graphs and photos transport information more quickly than large tables that are hard to retrieve relevant information from or written text that needs more time to read. Visualized metaphors can be understood by people of any language. Visual data increases knowledge and is easy to process, analyzed and remembered. It is also easier to consume information that way.
