This course will detail the “pattern prediction” domain of AI. This domain is particularly relevant for IoT. We will explain different algos:  Classification methods, Clustering methods, Ensemble learning algorithms, General methods for predicting arbitrarily-structured labels, Multilinear subspace learning algorithms, real-valued sequence labeling methods, and regression methods. Finally, we will show some possible applications.
