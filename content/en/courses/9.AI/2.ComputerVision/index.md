This course will introduce what computer vision is, and how it is used in IoT. We will give an overview of the different methods and algorithms used, in particular linear classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, Non-linear classifier, Support-Vector-Machines (SVM), Deep neural networks (DNN), Convolutional neural Network (CNN) and Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL).
