This module is aimed to introduce you into the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a very broad scientific field, we will concentrate on some areas that are well discovered and can bring a benefit to Internet of Things (IOT).

In the first course "Basics of AI" you will learn the rudiments of different disciplines of AI. How the subfields are related to each other and what are differences.

In the second course "Machine Learning" you will teach about the basics of finding a correlation in datasets. There are topics on some of the most used techniques in this field and how they can be compared to find the one that fits your purpose.

The course "Computer Vision" is aimed to show you principles of a vision-based approach, so everything relates to images and the retrieval of information from them. The first two topics cover the theoretical essentials. The last one shows some practical examples and how you can use them to serve your purpose.
