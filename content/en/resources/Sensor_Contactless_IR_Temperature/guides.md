# Introduction
MLX90614 is IR based contactless temperature sensor that can measure the temperature of a particular object between -70°C – 382.2°C and an ambient temperature of -40°C – 125°C without even making physical contact with an object under observation. It is embedded with an I2C port to communicate temperature reading to microcontrollers over an I2C bus. On top of that, it is provided with ESD protection to avoid malfunctioning of the sensor.

The tiny device is highly accurate and precise due to its powerful ADC. A 17-bit ADC is embedded in the module to output the values with 0.14 ˚C of resolution. Melexis has introduced different versions of this sensor based on input voltage requirements i.e., 3 Volts or 5volts and resolving power for different project requirements. But MLX90614 is a sensitive temperature sensor that has a long list of applications, especially in home automation
