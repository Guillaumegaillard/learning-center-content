# Specifications
- Operating temperature: -40 °C to +85 °C
- Dimensions: 25.5 × 15.2 × 2.48 mm
- Digital-output of 6-axis MotionFusion data. 9-axis fused data from Motion Processing Library
- Tri-Axis angular rate sensor (gyro) with a sensitivity up to 131 LSBs/dps and a full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000dps
- Tri-Axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and ±16g
