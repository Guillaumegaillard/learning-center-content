# Introduction

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny yet powerful technology that allows hobbyists, enthusiasts, and amateurs to explore a wide range of opportunities. This credit card-sized computer was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with accessibility, affordability, and versatility in mind.

Fundamentally, the Raspberry Pi is a platform that promotes exploration and innovation rather than merely a tiny computer. The Raspberry Pi offers an easy way to get started with electronics, whether you want to learn to program, make electronic projects, set up a media center, or even build your own mini-server.

With its many features, including HDMI outputs, USB ports, and GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, the Raspberry Pi is like an empty canvas just waiting for your artistic interpretation.
