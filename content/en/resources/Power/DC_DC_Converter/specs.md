# Features

- Input voltage: 2 V to 16 V (note: this regulator requires 3 V to start, but it can operate down to 2 V after startup)
- Output voltage: 2.5 V to 9 V (precision-adjustable using built-in 12-turn potentiometer)
- Typical maximum continuous output current: 1.5 A
- Precision-adjustable low-voltage cutoff with hysteresis can be used to protect batteries from over-discharging
- Power-good indicator can be used to tell when the regulator has reached and is maintaining its target output voltage
- Power-saving feature maintains high efficiency at low currents (quiescent current is less than 1 mA while enabled)
- Integrated over-temperature and short-circuit protection
- Small size: 0.5″ × 0.6″ × 0.25″ (12.7 × 15.3 × 6.4 mm)
- Enable pin for activating/deactivating the converter output
