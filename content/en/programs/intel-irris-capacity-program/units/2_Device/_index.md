The Intel-IrriS Device is, among the two main components of the system, the most specific of the project. 

Installed in the field, it periodically gathers the measurements from the ground sensors and transmits the values to the gateway using LoRa radio frames. 

The casing is waterproof and shelters the core microprocessor, on an Arduino board, the radio chip, the batteries (two AA alkaline, or 3 AAA NiMh, with or without a solar pannel), all the connectors and the On/Off switch.

Device's hardware
=================
Different versions of the device exist with different hardware parts. Two development took place during the project, the Off-the-shelf Waziup design and the DIY UPPA/IRD design. And different versions have been made available at different times of the project.

Let's focus on PCBs, radio chipsets, antennas, solar panels, and other chosen components.

The PCBs
--------
### WaziSense v2.0, Waziup design
